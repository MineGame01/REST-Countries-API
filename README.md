## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Navigation
- [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Icons
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Library for React
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Library for HTTP requests

### What I learned

I’m doing this project for the second time, the first time I tried to create styling using the Bootstrap library, but I couldn’t create a theme switch with it (I wanted to do it, but I didn’t know), then I rewrote all the styling in the Material UI framework, but It was difficult for me to style the basic components and I never did. And after all that, I decided to start writing the project a second time from scratch using the Styled Components library, and I managed to create components that can be used several times and also managed to create theme switching and saving to LocalStorage.

#### And in this project I learned.

- Learned the Styled Components library.
- Learned how to switch theme.
- Gained experience in code optimization.
- I learned a little how to work with LocalStorage.
- I learned a lot by reading the documentation about the libraries that were used to create the project.
- And much more!

### Continued development

#### Error window
I added something new to this project, this is an error window for http requests, and I want to further improve this development and use it in future projects.

#### Improvement
I also plan to continue improving this project by adding new features and improving the quality of the code.
